# PPCA Tutorial Paper
Tutorial paper on Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA).
This was written for STAT3007 (Deep Learning) at UQ in Sem 1, 2024. The task limited the paper to a maximum of 12 pages, including a coded demonstration and some exercises (w/ solutions) on the topic.

All work is my own unless stated otherwise. References can be found both in the tutorial paper and the code example.
